# Hi, I'm Saket Jain

I'm a technologist with a passion for building high-performance, scalable systems. I enjoy turning complex problems into elegant, efficient solutions—whether it's in financial systems, healthcare platforms, or real-time trading engines.

## What I Do

- Design and build large-scale distributed systems
- Architect real-time trading and payment platforms
- Develop intelligent AI/ML-based solutions
- Explore deep learning and computer vision
- Maintain my own algorithmic trading framework with live and backtesting support

## Interests

- **Artificial Intelligence** – I love diving into neural networks, computer vision, and building from scratch (YOLO, OCR, etc.)
- **Stock Markets** – Quantitative analysis, algo trading, backtesting strategies, and portfolio analytics
- **System Design** – Distributed databases, consistency models, and cloud-native architecture
- **Programming** – Python, Java, MongoDB, Spring Boot, TensorFlow, OpenCV

## Hobbies

When I’m not writing code or exploring new AI models, you’ll probably find me:

- Writing technical blogs to share my learnings
- Sketching out startup ideas in the AI and CV space
- Tinkering with microcontrollers like Micro:bit for fun electronics projects along with my son

### Automatic Traffic Rules Violation Detection
**Tech:** Python, YOLO, OpenCV, Tesseract OCR  
**Description:** A real-time AI system that automatically detects vehicles violating red lights and extracts their registration numbers from license plates using computer vision.

### Tax Form OCR
**Tech:** Keras, Tensorflow, OpenCV, PyTesseract  
**Description:** Demonstrates automated extraction of text from scanned tax forms. The solution aligns a scanned form image with a clean template, performs OCR using Tesseract, and post-processes the text to clean and structure the output.

### Algo Trading Framework
**Tech:** Python, MongoDB, Plotly  
**Description:** Developed a modular backtesting engine for positional trading. Supports multiple strategies, performance tracking (Sortino, PnL), and daily portfolio views.

### Text and Object Detection with Keras and OpenCV
**Tech:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Pytessract 
**Description:** Implemented a text detection model based on the EAST architecture. Combined bounding box regression with classification for text spotting in natural scenes.

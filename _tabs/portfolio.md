### Automatic Traffic Rules Violation Detection
**Tech:** Python, YOLO, OpenCV, Tesseract OCR  
**Description:** A real-time AI system that automatically detects vehicles violating red lights and extracts their registration numbers from license plates using computer vision.

### Tax Form OCR
**Tech:** PyTorch, Ultralytics YOLOv8, LabelImg  
**Description:** Demonstrates automated extraction of text from scanned tax forms. The solution aligns a scanned form image with a clean template, performs OCR using Tesseract, and post-processes the text to clean and structure the output.

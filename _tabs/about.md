Hi! I'm **Saket Jain** â€” someone whoâ€™s deeply curious about how things work and even more excited about building them.

### ðŸŒŸ What Drives Me

I love **technology** not just for what it can do, but for how it can make life simpler, smarter, and more connected.

- Iâ€™m endlessly fascinated by how machines **see** the world (hello, computer vision).
- I enjoy building things from scratch â€” whether itâ€™s a blog, a trading bot, or an automation script.
- My brain lights up when Iâ€™m solving a tough problem, simplifying a messy system, or watching a model learn.

But Iâ€™m also learning to embrace the slow moments â€” to enjoy the process, not just the output.

### ðŸŽ’ Beyond the Screen

When Iâ€™m not coding or experimenting, youâ€™ll probably find me:

- ðŸ›¶ Out in nature â€” walking, exploring, or just watching the clouds
- ðŸ“š Reading about psychology, decision-making, or a good sci-fi novel
- ðŸŽ§ Listening to ambient music while daydreaming about my next side project
- ðŸŽ® Playing the occasional strategy game (and definitely overthinking every move)

I believe the best ideas often come when you're not trying too hard.

### ðŸ“¸ This Blog

This space is where I share what Iâ€™m learning â€” from AI experiments and side projects to thoughts on creativity and curiosity. Itâ€™s not perfect, and thatâ€™s the point.

I hope something here inspires you to build, explore, or just think a little differently.

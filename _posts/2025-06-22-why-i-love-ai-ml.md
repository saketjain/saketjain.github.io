When I first heard about **machine learning**, it felt like magic — code that could _learn_ from data? Models that could make predictions, recognize faces, or generate human-like text? I was hooked.

Over time, I realized that AI isn’t magic. It’s **math, data, patterns, and intuition** — wrapped together in creative ways. And that’s exactly what I love about it.

### 🔍 Why AI/ML Fascinates Me

- **It’s a blend of science and art.** The math behind backpropagation is beautiful — but tuning a model or crafting a data pipeline is often more about creativity than formulas.
- **It touches everything.** From healthcare to finance, entertainment to agriculture — AI is reshaping how we solve problems.
- **It keeps evolving.** Every day there’s something new: better models, smarter prompts, faster training, or unexpected applications.

### 🧠 What I’m Exploring

Right now, I’m learning and building in:

- **Computer Vision** — object detection, license plate recognition, and image augmentation
- **Deep Learning** — YOLOv8, CNNs, and training custom models
- **Trading Algorithms** — using ML to analyze market data and build smarter strategies

But more than anything, I’m just trying to stay curious.

### 🎯 My Philosophy

I believe in learning by doing. Whether it’s building a proof-of-concept, automating a daily task, or experimenting with a new framework — I think every small project adds up to something meaningful.

This blog will be my space to share those learnings — the wins, the struggles, and the lightbulb moments.

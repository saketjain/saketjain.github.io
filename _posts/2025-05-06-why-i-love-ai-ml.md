title: "Why I Love AI & Machine Learning"

My AI journey started long back when I was in college. During those days it was more of a research topic. I did a research project involving fuzzy logic and digital signal processing where I first learned about convolutions. I tasted the real flavour of AI when I tried my hands on tenorflow js. I could run AI models in browser using React and Javascript. Using few lines of code I could do object detection, pose estimation and much more. It was amazing to see what could be achieved using AI especially in the field of computer vision. I was hooked.

### Why AI/ML Fascinates Me

- **It’s a blend of science and art.** The math behind backpropagation is beautiful — but tuning a model or crafting a data pipeline is often more about creativity than formulas.
- **It touches everything.** From healthcare to finance, entertainment to agriculture — AI is reshaping how we solve problems.
- **It keeps evolving.** Every day there’s something new: better models, smarter prompts, faster training, or unexpected applications.

### What I’m Exploring

Right now, I’m learning and building in:

- **Computer Vision** — object detection, license plate recognition, and image augmentation
- **Deep Learning** — YOLOv8, CNNs, and training custom models
- **Trading Algorithms** — using ML to analyze market data and build smarter strategies

But more than anything, I’m just trying to stay curious.

### My Philosophy

I believe in learning by doing. Whether it’s building a proof-of-concept, automating a daily task, or experimenting with a new framework — I think every small project adds up to something meaningful.

This blog will be my space to share those learnings — the wins, the struggles, and the lightbulb moments.
